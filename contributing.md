# Contributing
Welcome to our contribution guide! Make all your changes in branches, and merge them using PRs. Your PR will require a review.

This repository is organized such that each sub-directory is either a demo, or contains multiple related demos. For example, if someone made a GraphQL demo, it should be named something such as `graphql`.

Each sub-directory should contain:
* Any relevant files for the demo
* A `README.md` file describing how to setup and run the code, as well as any instructions if it is designed as a learning exercise
* The `README.md` should also contain a link to the relevant part of this repository's wiki
* The wiki should contain links to documentation, presentations, and resources for people to learn more about the technology

This does not all need to be done in one PR, *but* make it clear that there will be more PRs coming to address what is still missing, and make sure you add the rest on in a timely manner.
